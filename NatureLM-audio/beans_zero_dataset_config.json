Introduced in the paper NatureLM-audio paper ([Robinson et al., 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hJVdwBpWjt)), it brings together tasks from both existing datasets and newly curated resources.\n\nThe benchmark focuses on models that take a bioacoustic audio input (e.g., bird or mammal vocalizations) and a text instruction (e.g., \"What species is in this audio?\"), and return a textual output (e.g., \"Taeniopygia guttata\"). As a zero-shot benchmark, BEANS-Zero contains only a test split\u2014no training or in-context examples are provided.\n\nMany tasks originate from the original [BEANS benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12300), but BEANS-Zero adds new datasets and task types that broaden the evaluation scope.\n\n## Tasks and Applications\n\nBEANS-Zero supports a wide range of zero-shot evaluation tasks, including:\n- **Audio Classification** \u2014 Identify species or sound categories from animal vocalizations.\n- **Audio Detection** \u2014 Detect the presence of species in long-form recordings.\n- **Audio Captioning** \u2014 Generate natural language descriptions of acoustic scenes.\n\n## Dataset Composition\n\nBEANS-Zero combines data from several well-known sources. There are total of 91,965 samples (examples). It consists of two main groups:\n\n### Original BEANS Tasks\n\n- `esc-50`:  Generic environmental sound classification with 50 labels ([Piczak, 2015](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2733373.2806390), License: CC-BY-NC)\n- `watkins`: Marine mammal species classification with 31 species ([Sayigh et al., 2016](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/2.0000358), free for personal and academic use)\n- `cbi`: Bird species classification with 264 labels from the CornellBird Identification competition hosted on Kaggle ([Howard et al., 2020](https://kaggle.com/competitions/birdsong-recognition), License: CC-BY-NC-SA)\n- `humbugdb`: Mosquito wingbeat sound classification into 14 species ([Kiskin et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07607), License: CC-BY)\n- `enabirds`: Bird dawn chorus detection with 34 species ([Chronister et al., 2021](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.3329), License: CC0)\n- `hiceas`: Minke whale detection from the Hawaiian Islands Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (HICEAS) ([NOAA, 2022](https://doi.org/10.25921/e12p-gj65), free without restriction)\n- `rfcx`: Bird and frog detection from the Rainforest Connection(RFCx) data with 24 species ([LeBien et al., 2020]( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954120300637.), usage allowed for academic research)\n- `gibbons`: Hainan gibbon detection with 3 call type labels ([Dufourq et al., 2021]((https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.201)), License: CC-BY-NC-SA)\n\n### Newly Added Subsets\n\n- `unseen-species-*`: Unseen species classification with 200 species held out from AnimalSpeak ([Robinson et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10447250)), with each sub-dataset using common (`cmn`), scientific (`sci`), or taxonomic (`tax`) names\n- `unseen-genus-*`: Generalize to unseen genera (`cmn`/`sci`/`tax`)\n- `unseen-family-*`: Generalize to unseen families (`cmn`/`sci`/`tax`)\n- `lifestage`: Predicting the lifestage of birds across multiple species (e.g., adult, juvenile), curated from [xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org/)\n- `call-type`: Classifying song vs. call across multiple bird species, curated from [xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org/)\n- `captioning`: Captioning bioacoustic audio on AnimalSpeak ([Robinson et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10447250))\n- `zf-indv`: Determining whether a recording contains multiplezebra finches, using programmatically generated mixtures (1\u20134 individuals) ([Elie and Theunissen, 2016](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11905533.v1))\n\nEach sample is labeled with its source dataset and license.\n\n## Usage\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nds = load_dataset(\"EarthSpeciesProject/BEANS-Zero\", split=\"test\") \n\n# see the contents at a glance\nprint(ds)\n```\n```python\n# get audio for the first sample in the dataset, the 0th index\naudio = np.array(ds[0][\"audio\"])\nprint(audio.shape)\n\n# get the instruction (prompt / query) for that sample\nprint(ds[0][\"instruction_text\"])\n# the desired output (should *only* be used for evaluation)\nprint(ds[0][\"output\"])\n\n# the component datasets of BEANS-Zero are:\ncomponents, dataset_sample_counts = np.unique(ds[\"dataset_name\"], return_counts=True)\n\n# if you want to select a subset of the data, e.g. 'esc50'\nidx = np.where(np.array(ds[\"dataset_name\"]) == \"esc50\")[0]\nesc50 = ds.select(idx)\nprint(esc50)\n```\n\n```python\n# To stream the dataset instead of downloading it, first\nds = load_dataset(\"EarthSpeciesProject/BEANS-Zero\", split=\"test\", streaming=True)\n\nfor i, sample in enumerate(ds):\n    # check one sample\n    break\nprint(sample.keys())\n```\n\n## Data Fields\n\nThe following fields are present in each example:\n\n- **source_dataset** (str): One of the source datasets mentioned above\n- **audio** (Sequence[float]): The audio data as a list of floats.\n- **id** (str): Sample uuid.\n- **created_at** (str): Sample creation datetime in UTC\n- **metadata** (str): Each sample can have a different duration (in seconds) and a different sample rate (in Hz). The 'metadata' is a JSON string containing these two fields.\n- **file_name** (str): Audio file name\n- **instruction** (str): A prompt (a query) corresponding to the audio for your audio-text model with a placeholder for audio tokens. E.g. '<Audio><AudioHere></Audio> What is the scientific name for the focal species in the audio?'\n- **instruction_text** (str): Same as **instruction** but without the placeholder for audio tokens.\n- **output** (str): The expected output from the model\n- **task** (str): The task type e.g. classification / detection / captioning.\n- **dataset_name** (str): Names corresponding to the evaluation tasks, e.g. 'esc50' or 'unseen-family-sci'.\n- **license** (str): The license of the dataset. For example, 'CC-BY-NC' or 'CC0'.\n\n## Licensing\n\nDue to its composite nature, BEANS-Zero is subject to multiple licenses. Individual samples have the \"license\" field indicating the specific license for that sample. The dataset is not intended for commercial use, and users should adhere to the licenses of the individual datasets.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use BEANS-Zero, please cite the
